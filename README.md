# Project Name: Nature's Platter

## Project Description:
Nature's Platter is a responsive glossary static page built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. In my previous web_project_9, I learned very well about positioning classes like absolute, relative, z-index, and layout techniques. In this project, I just applied those previous learnings. I faced a little problem making the news section appear above the footer section by using position properties, because when I tried to do that, the news section layout broke since I didn’t use full width on the news section and I also used margin instead of padding. So that’s why the layout broke. I changed that, and then it worked perfectly. So after this project, now I am confident to design any page using Tailwind.

## What I newly learned while building this project:
Honestly, I just faced one problem in the footer section, so I think I just learned one new thing in this project — that is how to add a section above another section using position classes.  

**Why I faced few problems in this project:** The reason is web_project_9 and web_project_10 both have almost the same design, so I learned most of the things for this project in my previous web_project_9. In that project, I faced a lot of trouble, and those troubles helped me in this project.
